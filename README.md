# Predicting Patient Diagnosis Using Random Forest Classifier
### by: Akhil Sharma (102203028) and Amol Singh (102203354)

#### Problem Statement
The healthcare industry generates vast amounts of data, which, if analyzed effectively, can uncover patterns to aid in early diagnosis of diseases. This project addresses the problem of predicting patient diagnoses—categorized into Control, Benign, and PDAC (Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma)—using clinical and demographic data. Early detection is crucial for diseases like PDAC, as it significantly improves prognosis and treatment outcomes. The dataset for this project comprises patient health records, including both numerical and categorical features. Challenges include handling missing data, converting categorical data into a machine-readable format, and building a robust predictive model.

#### Proposed Solution

we employ a Random Forest Classifier, an ensemble machine learning method to tackle this problem
